# WebApp-Using-Kubernetes
# A simple NodeJS application using Kubernetes.
* This process is seggregated into four parts for precise understanding :
   * Configuring Webapp using .yaml file
   * Configuring ConfigMap using .yaml file
   * Configuring database (in this case MongoDB) using .yaml file
   * Configuring Secret (used for storing credentials) using .yaml file
## Note: Secret file should not be stored into any open-source as it contains sesntive information.
